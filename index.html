      title: "Grounded Protector",
      description: "You often carry tension—ready to spring into action—but you also have a steady center. You know how to push through discomfort, yet can tap into calm when needed.",
      nextSteps: "Try gentle chest‑opening stretches and notice how easily you can shift from “on guard” to “at ease.”"
    },
    // Flight + Regulation
    "Flight_Regulation": {
      title: "Balanced Explorer",
      description: "You’re naturally curious and energized, but you also know how to drop into presence when it matters.",
      nextSteps: "Anchor your energy with a 3‑breath check‑in before jumping into your next task or adventure."
    },
    // Freeze + Regulation
    "Freeze_Regulation": {
      title: "Steady Observer",
      description: "You hold steady—even under stress—and are comfortable with quiet or stillness. That steadiness can protect you, but can also hide tension.",
      nextSteps: "Invite gentle movement breaks (e.g., wrist rolls, shoulder shrugs) to remind your body it’s safe to soften."
    },
    // Regulation dominant
    "Regulation_": {
      title: "Harmonious Integrator",
      description: "You have a strong capacity for balance: you notice tension, restlessness, or stillness—and then bring yourself back to center.",
      nextSteps: "Alternate dynamic movement (dance, walking) with restful breathing to honor your flexibility."
    },
    // Fight dominant, low Reg
    "Fight_": {
      title: "Tense Sentinel",
      description: "You’re highly alert and ready for challenge. Your body often braces as if waiting for something.",
      nextSteps: "Explore “softening” techniques—like exhaling fully on a sigh or using gentle self‑hug holds—to practice letting your guard down."
    },
    // Flight dominant, low Reg
    "Flight_": {
      title: "Restless Voyager",
      description: "You’re always in motion—mentally and physically—and it’s hard to land into rest.",
      nextSteps: "Try micro‑pauses: stand still for 30 seconds, root your feet, then gently resume activity."
    },
    // Freeze dominant, low Reg
    "Freeze_": {
      title: "Braced Guardian",
      description: "You hold yourself tightly, bracing your torso and chest. It feels protective, but can leave you disconnected from ease.",
      nextSteps: "Begin with small “unfreezing” gestures—soft neck rolls or chest‑softening breaths—to remind your body it can move."
    },
    // Fight + Flight
    "Fight_Flight": {
      title: "Urgent Reactor",
      description: "You switch between gearing up (fight) and needing to escape (flight). That loop can feel chaotic, but shows you’re highly responsive.",
      nextSteps: "Place a hand on your heart before responding to break the loop and choose your next move."
    },
    // Flight + Freeze
    "Flight_Freeze": {
      title: "Anxious Lurker",
      description: "You oscillate between restless escape and frozen stillness. That swing shows how deeply your body craves both safety and movement.",
      nextSteps: "Practice slow “ground‑and‑release” cycles: inhale grounding, exhale softening."
    },
    // Fight + Freeze
    "Fight_Freeze": {
      title: "Rigid Defender",
      description: "You brace for action and for shutdown, holding tight even when still—leaving little space for reset.",
      nextSteps: "Explore gentle lengthening movements (like side stretches) with slow, easy breath to create space."
